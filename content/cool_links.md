### [NeoCities](https://neocities.org)

- Sites are reminiscent of Web 1.0, back when the web was the wold wild west without moderation, but also without the influence of search engines and commercialisation.
- A successfor to Geocities, which was bought over by Yahoo and shut down in 2009.

### [GIFCities](https://gifcities.org)
- Search engine for GIFs scrapped from Geocities.
- The "memes" of the 1990s. You can find stuff here that's , in a way, so old that its cool again.
- A project by the internet archive, and with a lot of research conduct on it.
