I have a bad habit of writing long form content.

Although great for cover stories on print publications like TheEdge, it doesn't suit the Internet where content is faster and snappier.

To fix this, I'm trying out a different process: - Incorporate Obsidian Publish and [Blot.im](http://Blot.im) - Remove images requirements from my blogs - Increase publishing cycles to daily (hopefully) - Being more public with my content - Giving myself permission to suck - Start copywork

Through these changes, I hope to reduce writing friction and maximise publication rates.

In a way, I'm trying out a format that's a mix between Twitter posts and newsletters. Look forward to more content moving forward!
