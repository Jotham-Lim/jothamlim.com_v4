**Changing Jobs for the Eighth Time**

*Where Am I Heading?*

I&#39;m currently embarking on a new venture, CoThinking, a marketing firm specialising in the B2B tech marketing sector.

My return to Innov8tif is a temporary step, with the management there providing significant support to help launch CoThinking.

*Why the Change?*

Now at 28, I&#39;ve spent a large portion of my adult life switching jobs, seeking a company to which I can dedicate myself. It&#39;s like Zhu Ge Liang waiting for a Liu Bei, as someone once said.

However, I&#39;ve come to realise that the most fertile ground is the one I nurture myself. Will I cultivate the perfect lawn? Or will it become overgrown with weeds and perish? Regardless, I now have more control over my destiny than ever before.

*What Lies Ahead?*

Uncertainty, fear, and a great deal of anxiety are on the horizon. I anticipate long hours, sleepless nights, heavy responsibilities, and necessary sacrifices.

Yet, I have friends who start and close businesses as if it&#39;s just another Tuesday. This is a new and unfamiliar path for me, so these feelings are to be expected.

In the end, I&#39;m confident that everything will be alright. As long as I continue to learn and practice how to 成人, things will work out.

*Reflecting on the Past*

Here&#39;s a brief history of my career journey:

-   Freelance work since I was 16.

Undertook random projects to support my hobbies.

-   Internship at Director&#39;s Think Tank.

The most challenging 90 days of my life, but it shaped me into the person I am today. I wouldn&#39;t recommend joining.

-   Videographer at ABC Studio.

A pleasant environment, but the pay wasn&#39;t commensurate with the workload. I often wonder how everyone there is faring.

-   Brand Producer at Winner Dynasty.

Caught a glimpse of society&#39;s underbelly.

-   Writer at Armani Media.

I was forced to learn networking. Met a fantastic boss who significantly influenced my leadership style.

-   Journalist at TheEdge.

Mastered proper storytelling and how to behave around influential people. Experienced the importance of supporting my team, thanks to another remarkable boss.

-   Marketing Manager at Innov8tif.

First experienced a livable wage. Deepened my understanding of professionalism. Had a taste of what it&#39;s like to be a boss.

-   Marketing Manager at ORLIG.

Applied my acquired skills and knowledge. This was the true &quot;executive&quot; stage of my life.
