I’ve never tried stinky tofu.

During the Taiwan trip, I remembered saying that I would die happily without ever trying it — but I noticed how packed most stalls were during night markets. Just like that, I easily succumbed to curiosity.

It was surprisingly bland tasting  — it tastes exactly like. Or all tofu, with a slightly less overwhelming stink. I guess it’s truly an acquired taste.

Also… 6 rounds of Chong Zhua Bing, 3 rounds of Xiao Long Bao, 2 rounds of Soy Milk.

But I never tried authentic Lu Rou Fan. That, I will die regretting.
