title: Chinese new year this year is sombre — its a tike where we need
---
CNY this year is sombre. There’s a-lot of harsh truths to consider. 
- Confronting the inevitability of mortality, for both ourselves and others.
- The shifting nature of relationships and responsibilities to one another.
- Pondering what it means to be a proper person.
- And of course… marriage, and the load that comes with it.

Change is constant, and change sucks. But it will happen whether I like it or not, and I can only *do whatever I can, however I can, while I still can.*
