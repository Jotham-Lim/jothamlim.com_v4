**I… have a complicated relationship with religion.**

For todays sermon, here are the main talking points:

- You have to commit your entire being into building a temple of gods extremely high and unique requirements. Entire being involves mind, body, soul and wealth (which was mentioned thrice).

- But commitment along is not enough — you have to be **purified** first: cleanse your mind of impure thoughts. There is no room for insecurity and doubt.

- Service should involve the commitment of both husband and wife. Disharmony in the family is an impurity.

- LGBTQ communities are an affront to the sanctity of marriage, and we are tasked with guiding them to the right path.

Im… not sire if i subscribe to these values.
