On my first Valentine’s Day with Jamie, I gave her a gas mask to remind her that she’s toxic — she gave me a poop stool to remind me that I was full of shit .

I barely used the poop stool for the past many years. I want to use it more often, now that the note she scribbled on permanent marker is fading.

“Dear Jotham, Happy Valentine’s Day! I hope this helps with the stick”
